# CraigsList App
 *For My Students* 
If you are doing any of my courses make sure you are using the right version this project is using gulp version 4.0.1 to view previous versions switch branches to older version

So I built this for all the new web developers... My Goal is to save you time from the bullsh*t of spending hours looking for ways to speed up your learning. Sometimes all we want to do is just code.
(if you are coming from my [youtube channel CodingPhase ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC46wWUso9H5KPQcoL9iE3Ug) I will base all my tutorials from this starter kit)

I broke it down in simple steps to get you going.
